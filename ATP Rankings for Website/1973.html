        <p>
          The current men’s circuit is becoming increasingly Slam-centric, meaning that the Slams have a value infinitely superior to that of lower-category tournaments and to all other tournaments in general. With the 2009 reform, in which it was decided to award 2000 points to the Slam winner and 1000 to the winner of what used to be called the Masters—tournaments that, precisely because of the number of points assigned, were renamed Masters 1000—a significant gap was dug between the four biggest tournaments in the world and everything else. Add to this the 128-player draw and the best-of-five format, which nowadays is played only at the Majors, and you have all the attention shifting onto them. But has it always been like this in the past? The Slams have always had a magical aura accompanying them since their establishment in 1924, even though they did not need any official certification: all players in the world knew which tournaments were the most important, but in many respects they were different from their current status.

        <p>
          On one hand, one must consider the pre-Open era in which, starting from 1926, the Slams were closed to professionals—something that initially produced a negligible effect, but which from the Tilden era onward and until 1968 widened the gap more and more between the tournaments that were the most important from a media and historical standpoint and the tournaments in which the best players, i.e. the professionals, actually competed. In 1968 the beginning of a partial reconciliation took place, but since the wound had been very deep and long-lasting, it took many years before everything leveled out and there was a certain continuity that allowed people to have a clear idea of how to judge one result over another. Everyone knows that the Open Era begins in 1968, and just as many know that the first official ranking dates back to August 23, 1973, so there is a five-year gap in which, although pros and amateurs finally played together, there was no objective and, above all, deterministic system for deciding tournament seedings. Instead, things were done the old-fashioned way: the organizers assigned the seeds, which, as you can imagine, were not 100% objective as they are today.

          Thanks to a zealous research effort, we have finally managed to uncover the ATP ranking point system from 1973 to 1978, which for many years had remained obscure, and this shows us how “unimportant” it was considered at the time—even by the players themselves, who, lacking a fixed point of reference, literally did not know what ranking position they held from week to week, also because, contrary to what one might think, the ranking was not published weekly.
        </p>

        <p>
          The basic rule for a tournament to be considered eligible for the ATP ranking was to have a 16-player draw with a minimum prize money of $20,000. The discovery of this simple rule opens a new horizon for evaluating the tournaments of those years because, as some immediately realized, the tournaments that awarded points came in all shapes and sizes. There were Grand Prix tournaments, WCT tournaments, those of the Riordan circuit (Connors’s “phony” ones, so to speak), and the tournaments of the obscure European clay-court circuit called the European Spring Circuit. With so many things on the fire, the risk was that they might get burned, so to avoid confusion we must explain in detail the logic that held together such a heterogeneous set of tournaments.

        <p>
          The constant that helps us a bit and keeps us from getting our fingers burned is that ATP points were proportional to the prize money awarded by the tournament, with a few exceptions represented by the Slams or certain special events. Let’s look at the details.
        </p>

        <p>
          We immediately notice that there were as many as 6 categories, unlike the 3 that exist today, and that the difference in points was not as pronounced as it is now: winning a tournament in the highest category—namely the category represented by the Slam tournaments—gave 50 points, while the next category awarded 35, so the proportions are different: 50% less today, 30% less in 1973. Even the difference between category B and C seems minimal and should have a parallel with today’s 1000 and 500, but as in the first case, the difference is smaller.
        </p>

        <p>
          To carry out a more precise analysis, let us look in detail at the entire 1973 season. Don’t be frightened! In this mess of tournaments, categories, and prize money, we can immediately extrapolate a few conclusions:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>The Triple Crown tournaments (Slams excluding the Australian Open) represented the top tournaments regardless of prize money, and in this case the determining factors were the 128-player draw and the best-of-five format.</li>
          <li>There is a tournament with prize money higher than the Slams that is nonetheless placed in the lower category—Las Vegas—whose prize money was indeed enormous (after all, in Las Vegas they either do things big or they don’t do them at all), but the 32-player draw and the best-of-three format inevitably placed it in the lower box.</li>
          <li>There are tournaments that, despite their low prize money, are “upcasted” to the higher category. We are talking about the Australian Open, which because of its Slam status was moved from F to D, as well as the Queen’s tournament, due to the boycott of the Wimbledon Championships.</li>
          <li>The early rounds of tournaments did not award points.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          What we can conclude is that although the Slams were not classified under today’s parameters, they held a privileged position and always represented the most important tournaments of the year. Even Roland Garros, with its relatively low prize money, was always a Triple Crown event. Las Vegas, despite its exorbitant and higher-than-all prize money, remained below, and the Australian Open—with a field and prize money not worthy of a Slam—was promoted to the higher category precisely because of its tradition.
